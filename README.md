# thewire-crossposting
Allow users to link their Twitter account, and automatically share their updates on the wire to Twitter!

Users can share their posts to Facebook through a pop-up dialog (automatic posting has been disabled in the Facebook API).

If the user mentioned a link in their post, that link will be used for the share dialog. Otherwise, the share dialog will link to the user's profile on the elgg site.
